HTML ENTITIES:
entities are used in html to show tags on website 
replace < with &lt; and > with &gt;
using <pre> tag if user give lines in their code then it will be seen on website bec of <pre> tag
*if you want space in your output you can not get tha with pressing spacebar  as html ignore all the space 
for that we use &nbsp ,as many  time it is written you will get that much spaces in your output screen

In HTML, entities are used to represent characters that have a special meaning in HTML or that are not easily typed on a keyboard. They begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). Some common examples include:

&lt; for the less-than symbol (<)
&gt; for the greater-than symbol (>)
&amp; for the ampersand symbol (&)
&quot; for the double quotation mark (" " ")
&apos; for the single quotation mark (" ' ")
