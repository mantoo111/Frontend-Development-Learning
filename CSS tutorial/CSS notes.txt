                                            ..........CSS........
stands for cascade style sheet
3 ways to add CSS in html:
 1-inline
 2-internal(can be added by using <style>tag in html)
 3-external(is to create .css file and all your css style in that file)


 padding: 10px 20px 30px 40px; /* top, right, bottom, left */
 padding: 10px 20px; /* top & bottom, right & left */
 padding: 10px 20px 30px; /* top, right & left, bottom */

 margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px; /* top, right, bottom, left */
  margin: 10px 20px; /* top & bottom, right & left */
  margin: 10px 20px 30px; /* top, right & left, bottom */
 *imp concept:
 selectors in css:
 if it is direct child then we can write like 
 div >p means div ka child p us ko style karo
 but if p is descendant then, i will write like div p
>hover:means when you take your mouse to that text or element it will be filled with color 
syntax:
button:hover {
  background-color: red;
}

>margin collapse :means from which max margin that will be applied

 >box-sizing: border-box; /*this line means that content + padding + border  should be  the height value that is given above*/

                               specificity
 :is used when for example h1 is green red and h1 is given green color then which one will be applied is can be specified by specificity
it is basically used when different selectors are used like in one html there is id,class,etc then which will be applied it depend on the order
inline style>id selector>class or attribute selector>element selector>universal selector

specificity example:

<!--<div><h1 style="color:blue class="yellow cred cpurple">css specification</h1> </div>  style attribute and has max specificity-->

<!--attribute selector:

<div><h1 class="yellow cred cpurple"data-x="a">css specification</h1> </div>
then in style tag write like
[data-x=a]{
background color:red
}-->

cascade algorithm:

the cascade is an algo for solving conflicts where multiple css is applied to an html.that is why the text appears purple

-> understanding cascade will help you to know how browser  resolves conflicts ,cascade has 4 distinct stages:

1 position and  order of appearance(that is at the end will be applied)
2 specialty
3 origin
4 importance( where important is written that will be applied),it can over ride inline style

font sizing:

em means itne guna of font-size ,default is 16px
when i write 2em then font sze will be 32px

for the concpt of em,rem etc see this link for better understanding:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Values_and_Units

shadows and outlines in css:
1-box shadows:
box-shadows:h-offset v-offset blur spread color insert;
->h-offset and v-offset :deermnes the shadow horizontal and vertical position
->blur :the larger the value,the blurier the shadow
->spraed: expands or shrinks the shadow size
->color:
->insert:makes the shadow inner

outlines:are ouside the border remember this just

list styles:

list consists of markers,markers are those left side dots or numbers that appers with elements
if i write list-style-position: inside;
then that style i apply to element will be also applied to to those markers


overflow property:
when your text get out from the border2 ways to adjust it
1-by using overflow property
2-by setting overflow auto it means if overflow occurs then overflow will be applied

position :
1- static position :which means no chnge will occur for that particular
2-relative position:which means you can position it from top,left right,bottom
3-absolute position:
->child check if its parent is positioned or not if it is positioned then position left,right,left,bottom will be applied relative to its parent
->In the case when child  finds  that its parent is not positioned then child positioned will be applied relative to html

flex:are used to display list itmes horizataly
display:flex;

css variable:
->these variable can hold color,strings,values(px etc),or any thhing that you want to change.
syntax:
:eoot{
  --color:red;
}

 clear and float:
 float means to appaer something on right or left
 example text float on right or left  of image

 clear:means not allowing img to appear either on right oe left any where

 through css you can dynamicaly insert the text,
 .boxes::before{
  content:"ansa";
 }

  flexbox:
  flex direcction:row
  flex direcction:column
  ->container propery:these property can be applied just
  border: 2px solid red;
display: flex;
height: 80vh;
/* justify-content: center; */
/* align-items: center;  for one line*/
/* flex-direction:column-reverse; */
flex-wrap: wrap;
align-content: center;/*for multiple lines to contre*/
/* there ia no justify items in flexbox */
flex-flow: row wrap;/*flex direcction ,then flex*/
gap:30px;
column-gap: 10px;
row-gap: 10px;/*for these two lines you can just wrte like gap:row col*/

->itms property:
order: jitna zada utna last ma hoga
flexgrow:
 flex-shrink:2 ;ability to shrink when the page size decreases upto 2

Grid:
in which you can tell how many rows, columns by grid-templete column 120px 100px;

grid-template-rows :
The CSS property grid-template-rows is used in the CSS Grid Layout to define the number and size of the rows in a grid container. The value 100px 100px 100px 100px specifies the height of each row in the grid.

Here's what it means:

The grid will have 4 rows.
Each row will have a height of 100 pixels.
->dont use padding in flex and grid instead use gap;


Transform:(used to hide the nav bar)
in css there are 2 types of Transform
1-2D Transform:
this property allows the content to be structured in a way like translate,rotate,scale or skew etc as it is 2D therefore the content is transformed into x and y dimensions
syntax:
transform:rotate(80deg);(both in x and y axis)
transform:rotateX(78deg);along x and y axis
transform:scale(1.6);to enlarge the box you can do along x and y axis
transform:skew(5deg);somehow tilted can be along x and y axis but can not be in z axis remember
transform:translate(90deg);can be for x and y axis
trandform:origin(this is used when you want to rotate at a particular origin)
->for all the above to be applid in just single line you can write like
transform: translate(34%) skew(40deg) translate(45%);
2-3D trandform:
x,y and z axis 

Animation:

for simple use transition for complex use animation or where elements are repeated  you have to apply animation for diffrent elements 
animation:

@keyframes ansaAnimation{
            from{
                transform:translateX(1000px)
            }
        }

following property will be applied on box for animation;
.box{
        width: 34px;
        height: 45px;
        background-color: bisque;
        animation: ansaAnimation;
        animation-duration: 3s;
        animation-iteration-count: infinite; /*or you can give time like 3*/
        animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.42, 0.09, 0, 1.05);
        animation-delay: 11s;
        /* animation-delay: alternate-reverse; */
        animation-play-state: paused;
      }
animation syntax:
animation:name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode;(for single line )

The animation-fill-mode property in CSS specifies how a CSS animation should apply styles to its target before and after its execution. There are four possible values for animation-fill-mode:

none: The default value. The animation will not apply any styles to the target before or after the animation is executed.

forwards: After the animation ends, the target will retain the computed values set by the last keyframe encountered during execution.

backwards: Before the animation starts, the target will apply the values defined in the first keyframe, during the period specified by animation-delay.

both: The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards, extending the properties in both directions.

->css can be many like @arfanAnimation:{}...
