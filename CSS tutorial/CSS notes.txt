                                            ..........CSS........
stands for cascade style sheet
3 ways to add CSS in html:
 1-inline
 2-internal(can be added by using <style>tag in html)
 3-external(is to create .css file and all your css style in that file)

 *imp concept:
 selectors in css:
 if it is direct child then we can write like 
 div >p means div ka child p us ko style karo
 but if p is descendant then, i will write like div p
>hover:means when you take your mouse to that text or element it will be filled with color 
syntax:
button:hover {
  background-color: red;
}

>margin collapse :means from which max margin that will be applied

 >box-sizing: border-box; /*this line means that content + padding + border  should be  the height value that is given above*/

                               specificity
 :is used when for example h1 is green red and h1 is given green color then which one will be applied is can be specified by specificity
it is basically used when different selectors are used like in one html there is id,class,etc then which will be applied it depend on the order
inline style>id selector>class or attribute selector>element selector>universal selector

specificity example:

<!--<div><h1 style="color:blue class="yellow cred cpurple">css specification</h1> </div>  style attribute and has max specificity-->

<!--attribute selector:

<div><h1 class="yellow cred cpurple"data-x="a">css specification</h1> </div>
then in style tag write like
[data-x=a]{
background color:red
}-->

cascade algorithm:

the cascade is an algo for solving conflicts where multiple css is applied to an html.that is why the text appears purple

-> understanding cascade will help you to know how browser  resolves conflicts ,cascade has 4 distinct stages:

1 position and  order of appearance(that is at the end will be applied)
2 specialty
3 origin
4 importance( where important is written that will be applied),it can over ride inline style

font sizing:

em means itne guna of font-size ,default is 16px
when i write 2em then font sze will be 32px

for the concpt of em,rem etc see this link for better understanding:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Values_and_Units

shadows and outlines in css:
1-box shadows:
box-shadows:h-offset v-offset blur spread color insert;
->h-offset and v-offset :deermnes the shadow horizontal and vertical position
->blur :the larger the value,the blurier the shadow
->spraed: expands or shrinks the shadow size
->color:
->insert:makes the shadow inner

outlines:are ouside the border remember this just

list styles:

list consists of markers,markers are those left side dots or numbers that appers with elements
if i write list-style-position: inside;
then that style i apply to element will be also applied to to those markers


overflow property:
when your text get out from the border2 ways to adjust it
1-by using overflow property
2-by setting overflow auto it means if overflow occurs then overflow will be applied

position :
1- static position :which means no chnge will occur for that particular
2-relative position:which means you can position it from top,left right,bottom
3-absolute position:
->child check if its parent is positioned or not if it is positioned then position left,right,left,bottom will be applied relative to its parent
->In the case when child  finds  that its parent is not positioned then child positioned will be applied relative to html

flex:are used to display list itmes horizataly
display:flex;

css variable:
->these variable can hold color,strings,values(px etc),or any thhing that you want to change.
syntax:
:eoot{
  --color:red;
}

 clear and float:
 float means to appaer something on right or left
 example text float on right or left  of image

 clear:means not allowing img to appear either on right oe left any where
